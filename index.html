        <div class="dialogue"><strong>Doctor:</strong> That sounds really tough. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?</div>
        <div class="dialogue"><strong>Maya:</strong> It started a few weeks ago, but it keeps getting worse. Some days I can barely do anything.</div>
        <div class="dialogue"><strong>Doctor:</strong> You’re not alone, and I want you to know that we take these symptoms seriously. Can you tell me if anything makes them better or worse?</div>
        <div class="dialogue"><strong>Maya:</strong> Rest sometimes helps, but everything seems harder lately. Being in the sun makes the rash worse.</div>
        <div class="dialogue"><strong>Doctor:</strong> Thank you for sharing that. Our next step will be to run some tests to better understand what’s going on. While we wait for those results, is there anything you’re most worried about right now?</div>
        <div class="dialogue"><strong>Maya:</strong> I’m worried no one will find out what’s wrong. I just want to feel normal again.</div>
        <div class="dialogue"><strong>Doctor:</strong> I understand how frustrating it is not to have answers. We’ll work together to figure this out, and I’ll keep you updated every step of the way. If you feel worse or have new symptoms, please let us know right away. And if you have questions or concerns at any point, I’m here to listen.</div>
